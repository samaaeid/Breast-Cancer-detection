# Breast-Cancer-detection
Classfication using logistic regression ML algorithm applied to Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant

# Description
### Programming language: R
> 1. data cleaning and preparation.
> 2. Built a Statistical model to detect whether the patient has Malignant or Benign tumor.
> 3. Visualized Training data and testing data
> 4. Accuracy

# Dataset information
## The dataset consists of the following fields :
> 1. Sample code number: id number
> 2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
> 3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
> 4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
> 5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
> 6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
> 7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
> 8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
> 9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
> 10. Mitoses: 1 - 10
> 11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

There are 699 instances and each containing information on 9 features of the tumor. The last field is the Class field specifying which class the tumor belongs to.
